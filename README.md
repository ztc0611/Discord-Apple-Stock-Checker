# Discord-ASD-Stock-Checker
Discord bot that checks for Apple Studio Displays in the United States using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## How to Run
Download this repo, create a file in the root directory named "token.txt" and place your discord bot token within. Change the server channel IDs in "bot.py" to match your own channels. Run "bot.py" and it will do the rest.

### Thanks
